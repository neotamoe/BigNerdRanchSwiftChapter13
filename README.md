#### Learning Highlights
* closures are discrete bundles of functionality that can be used in your application to accomplish specific tasks

* closures and functions can keep track of internal information encapsulated by a variable defined in their enclosing scope


#### Closure Syntax

```
{(parameters) -> return type in
  // code
}
```
